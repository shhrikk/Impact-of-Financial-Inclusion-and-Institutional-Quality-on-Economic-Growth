# Impact-of-Financial-Inclusion-and-Institutional-Quality-on-Economic-Growth

I analyzed data from WDI and IMF Financial Surveys for 20 African countries.
Applied statistical techniques like Interpolation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, conducted stationarity tests (LLC and IPS), and implemented a 2-step system GMM approach for econometric modeling. 

I found a significant positive relationship between financial inclusion and per capita real GDP, with mixed but significant effects of institutional quality on economic growth.
